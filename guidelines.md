Agile Bridge's Company Values

This is what I've been able to come up with, please contribute to it if you think something is worded incorrectly or if I've left something out:

-   Get it done
-   Make money so we can grow
-   Keep it Agile
-   We're craftsmen, then designers/developers
-   People over processes and tools
-   Customerization, or the customization of solutions to suit our clients/customers
-   Adaptable design which scales
-   Keeping the future in mind
    

Philosophy for design

Design for Agile Bridge first, then empathize the design for the client/customer

Document Styleguide

Each logical grouping of information should be grouped under a heading.

Heading format:

-   Font - Calibri
-   Font size - 14px
-   Text decoration - Underlined
    

A paragraph is used to describe information, and bullet points should be used where possible to make reading easier.

Bolding words should be used to emphasize key words for quick reading at a glance.

Paragraph format:

-   Font - Calibri
-   Font size - 11px
-   Text decoration - None, bold, or italic
    

Teamwork

"If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself." --Henry Ford

We make decisions  together, we design  together, and we develop  together, all with the same  goals in mind; Unification and Uniformity

Each team  member has the same  authority, and respect should be given where due.

If you feel the need to contest a particular design  element within this system, please follow this process:

-   Collate your facts
    
-   Present the facts to the team
    
-   Allow the other  party(ies) to contest your concerns, if they so choose
    
-   Allow for a unanimous  decision
    
-   If you brought it up, you  implement  the  change
    
-   Be respectful and mindful, all of the time
    

Changes

There should be a uniform  way to specify  changes within this document, as we currently do not have versioning on this document in this format (to my knowledge).

Please make sure to follow this process:

-   Attain team buy-in before making any fundamental changes (See teamwork guidelines above)
    
-   Make sure to format the new  content in a clear, concise, and descriptive manner so that everybody can understand the context and the meaning in the new content.
    
-   Apply the change to the document, and place your stamp on the change as seen below:
    
    First  Iteration:
    
    Jack had to climb the wall in order to retrieve the ball from the neighbor's garden
    
    Second  Iteration:
    
    Jack had to climb the fence in order to retrieve the ball from his neighbor's garden

Once there is enough clarity on the structure of this document and Design  System (MVP), we will place it in Source  Control where proper versioning and pull  requests can be made.

We will then collaboratively decide on the correct  process to follow when making a pull  request.
